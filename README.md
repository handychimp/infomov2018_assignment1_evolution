# Computer Vision - Assignments 1 to 3 
Assignments 1 to 3 of the Computer Vision course at Utrecht University. We were provided with a C++ project that included a template and some starting code for the motion tracking of individuals walking around a room.

We were required to:

- Install and setup opencv computer vision library
- Calibrate the cameras
- Render the individuals as voxels
- Improve the accuracy of voxel rendering by utilising A.I. / Computer Vision techniques
- Track and store the paths of the 4 walkers
